# planets-sim
A simple planet motion simulation built in Rust. This is my first project in Rust after reading "The Book" and doing some rustlings.

Aims of this project are:
- Learn Rust!
- Do some numerical computing and physics in Rust
- Learn more about testing in Rust (in particular mocking)
- Hands on experience with the Rust GUI
